# Study Of Power Variation On CANDLE-GFR Using OpenMC Code

This study analyzes the GFR core using CANDLE burn up strategy with Uranium
Carbide as the starter fuel and natural uranium as the fresh fuel. The simulation uses the Monte
Carlo method in the OpenMC program and uses the ENDF/B-VIII.0 library. CANDLE-GFR was
tested for power variations of 600 MWth, 800 MWth, and 1000 MWth to determine changes in
multiplication effective and flux distribution. Keff results show that the power value is inversely
proportional to Keff's. In the first year the reactor operated the Keff value at each power variation of
600 MWth, 800 MWth, and 1000MWth are 1.085, 1.082, and 1.078 respectively. The axial flux
distribution shows the difference in each variation of the core burn up power of about 25 cm, respectively, from 600 MWth, 800MWth, and 1000 MWth.
